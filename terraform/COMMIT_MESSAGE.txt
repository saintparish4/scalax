feat: add Terraform infrastructure for rate limiter platform

Infrastructure Components:
- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- DynamoDB tables for rate limiting and idempotency tracking
- Kinesis stream for event publishing
- ECS Fargate cluster with Application Load Balancer
- CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for monitoring

Module Structure:
- networking: VPC, subnets, internet gateway, NAT gateway
- dynamodb: Rate limit and idempotency tables with proper indexes
- kinesis: Stream configuration with configurable shards and retention
- ecs: Fargate cluster, service, task definition, ALB, and IAM roles

Features:
- Modular architecture for maintainability and reusability
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, prod) via tfvars
- Comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring with dashboards
- Alarms for CPU, memory, and error rate thresholds
- Proper IAM roles and policies for least privilege access
- Configurable resource sizing and scaling parameters
